## Key Points
- Dependency injection :
	- setter injection
	- constructor injection
- Bean scopes
	- Singleton: only one bean is used for all the injection 
	- Prototype: create a new instance every time we ask for it 
	- Request: it is only for spring mvc 
	- Session: it is only for spring mvc 
	
- Default scope of bean is singleton
